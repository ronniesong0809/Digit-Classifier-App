# Digit Classifier

Copyright (c) 2019 Ronnie Song

This is a simple Android Digit Classifier that allows its users to drawing a digit, then recognize it using the TFLite File. 

Demo: [here](https://github.com/ronniesong0809/Digit-Classifier-App/releases/tag/v1.0)

This project is adapted from the original [Tensorflow digit_classifier](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/blob/master/lite/codelabs/digit_classifier/README.md), then convert from Koltin to Java.

## What I've Learned
*  Experience the difference between Java and Kotlin in Android
*  Create Android interface that takes user input
*  Train models on mnist with Keras in Google Colab and then converting them into TFLIte format
*  Deploy a static TFLite model to Android app
*  Deploy TFLite models dynamically served from *Firebase ML* to Android app
*  Track user feedback to measure model accuracy with *Firebase Analytics*
*  Analyze performance of the model via *Firebase Performance*
*  Select a model via Remote Config via *Firebase Remote Config*
*  Experiment with different models Effectiveness via *Firebase A/B Testing*
